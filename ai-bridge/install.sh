#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# install.sh — provision (or refresh) an ai-bridge INSTANCE.
#
#   Usage:
#     install.sh [TARGET]              # install/refresh an instance at TARGET (default: cwd)
#     install.sh --uninstall [TARGET]  # remove only the symlinks this script created
#     install.sh --help
#
# It does two things, mirroring how the parent ai-setup repo provisions ~/.claude:
#   1. SYMLINKS the generic machinery in `symlink/` into TARGET (file granularity,
#      absolute targets). Updates to the template propagate to every instance.
#      These paths are gitignored in the instance (managed block in .gitignore).
#   2. COPIES the `seed/` content into TARGET *only if absent* — never clobbering
#      instance data (objectives/projects/knowledge/log/config/CLAUDE.md).
#
# Idempotent: re-running relinks cleanly and reports already-linked entries.
# Backs up any conflicting real file as <name>.bak.<epoch> before linking.

# 1b. The awaiting-you queue, created ONLY on the first stamp.
#
# AWAITING.md is opt-in by presence: the project-manager refreshes it only when
# it exists and never creates it, so deleting it turns the startup nudge off for
# good. That switch is the whole design — but it also means a brand-new instance
# would start with the queue OFF, and the SessionStart nudge would never fire
# until someone happened to read the docs and touch the file. So the installer
# provides the initial file, exactly once.
#
# It must NOT run on a refresh: re-creating the file would silently undo a
# deliberate `rm`, which is the one thing the off switch has to survive. That's
# what FIRST_STAMP guards. It's also gitignored, so this never becomes tracked
# state. Content is a valid empty queue, so show-awaiting.sh stays silent until
# the first tick fills it in.

Derived and gitignored — **do not hand-edit**. Rewritten each `/pm-loop` tick
from `projects/*/tasks/*.md`. Delete this file to turn the queue off for good;
the loop never recreates it. Last refreshed: never (no tick has run yet).
